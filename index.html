    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p style="text-align:left;">
        I am a CS PhD student of <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London (UCL)</a>. I received my Bachelor's degree in <i>Information Security</i> at the University of Science and technology of China (USTC).
        My id as a hacker is <i>hklst4r</i> and I love to break things.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">
        My research interests primarily focus on blockchain technology, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications, and their security implications. 
        I've been actively engaged in the DeFi ecosystem since 2021. I continuously explore and implement highly profitable trading strategies (Ref. <a href="#profitable-strategies">Highly Profitable Trading Strategy</a>).
        I sometimes publish major Web3 attack analysis on my twitter <a href="https://x.com/hklst4r">@hklst4r</a>.
        I am also an active bug hunter in Web3, securing $10K+ in bounties (Ref. <a href="#bugs">Bug Bounties</a>).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">
        I used to be a CTF player in Crypto and Misc. I was the team captain of <a href="https://nebuu.la/">NEBULA</a>,
        which achieved an annual global ranking of 137th (top 0.33% globally) on <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/168863">CTFtime</a> (Summer 2022-Summer 2023).

        <h2 id="bugs">Bug Bounties & Whitehat</h2>
        <p>I have submitted several bug reports for various projects. Below listed some of them that are released to public.</p>
        <li>
            <a href="https://x.com/ImpermaxFinance/status/1988636882977116667?s=20">Impermax Finance Exploit</a>, there was a rounding issue in Impermax Finance's liquidation mechanism causing an attacker to steal ~$500K. I helped the team analyze and reconstruct the attack, preventing potential future losses.
        <li>
            <a href="https://x.com/hklst4r/status/1986419422316134482">USDX Bad Debt on Lista</a> , there was a rugpull on $USDX and a risk curator on Lista has 5M exposure to this asset. I managed to rescue around $400K for friends of mine during this crisis. Credits: <a href="https://x.com/ee_sien/status/1986695432656068929">1</a> , <a href="https://x.com/ScarlettWeb3/status/1986640478478176747">2</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://x.com/ArcadiaFi/status/1945561599433216268">Arcadia Finance</a> (20M TVL when the hack happened), there was an <a href="https://x.com/ArcadiaFi/status/1947730529010528604">approval-related attack</a>. I successfully performed whitehat rescues within hours of the original attacker, and helped the team preventing millions of potential losses.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/sumer.money">Sumer.Money Lending</a> (over $100M TVL as of May 2025), LP token price manipulation leads to drain of the market.

        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://tokenlon.im/">Tokenlon</a>, flaw in token design leads to continous arbitrage opportunities.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/huckleberry">Huckleberry Lending</a>, interest-bearing token borrowing leads to drain of the market.

            ...
        </li>
        <h2 id="profitable-strategies"> Highly Profitable Trading Strategy</h2>
        <p>This term draws inspiration from <i>Avraham Eisenberg</i>, a self-proclaimed "Applied Game Theorist" who famously <a href="https://x.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326197241180160">netted $115 million by manipulating a token's price</a>. I use it to describe lucrative, low-risk trading opportunities I've successfully identified and leveraged. (To be clear, these are not attacks or exploits.)</p>
        <li>
            <a href="https://x.com/hklst4r/status/1985872151077953827">Nov 2025: Balancer Hack</a>, I managed to short $BERA, the governance token of berachain during the Balancer hack incident. The largest DEX on berachain is BEX, a Balancer fork, who was exploited for ~12M and the chain paused. This led to $BERA's price drop.
        </li>
        <li>
            July 2025, I built an option arbitrage bot that discovered the price difference on a decentralized option market and Polymarket. This resulted in a risk-free, astonishing 320% monthly return. (Where the protocol fixed this pricing in the next month).
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://x.com/hklst4r/status/1890401783622619600">Feb 2025: Eggs Protocol</a>, By purchasing the EGGS token within 5 blocks of creation, I made a profit of 5x.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://x.com/hklst4r/status/1846660903862735050">October 2024: Radiant Protocol Incident</a>, Following a hack that drained 2/3 of the protocol's Total Value Locked (TVL), I capitalized on the ensuing panic by establishing a strategic short position on the governance token.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://x.com/peckshield/status/1752279373779194011">January 2024: MIM Depegging Event</a>, I seized the opportunity to purchase MIM at a discount, effectively rebalancing my position on the Abracadabra platform.
        </li>
        <li>
        <a href="https://x.com/circle/status/1634391505988206592">March 2023: USDC Depegging Crisis</a>, During this event, I used AAVE to create a DAI (long)/ USDT (short) position. Despite DAI's initial depeg alongside USDC due to the Peg Stability Module (PSM) allowing 1:1 USDC to DAI swaps, I recognized that Maker DAO's substantial reserve fund could potentially cover bad debt and stabilize DAI even if USDC's value plummeted to zero.         </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rahulrai/2022/05/17/the-death-spiral-how-terras-algorithmic-stablecoin-came-crashing-down/">May 2022: Luna/UST Death Spiral</a>, I managed to short $LUNA when $UST starts to depeg.
